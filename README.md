As a busy professional, I need to keep order and plan multiple tasks to be scheduled during my workday.  
This dayplanner will help me keep everything in order. 
To use it, just pick a time-block, and enter a task due at   time, whether it is a meeting, a scheduled
call to make, or any task that needs to be done at that time.
To save this task, just hit the cooresponding cloud to the right of your text.  This will save to local storage,
that is, storge on your computer.  Don't worry!  The space it takes up is miniscule!
Here are the acceptance criteria of my day planner.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
