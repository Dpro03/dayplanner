# Dayplanner

## Description

This Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the 9am -5pm workday. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Day.js.

## Usage
As a busy professional, I need to keep a certain order to my day. I have many tasks on my schedule every day.  
This dayplanner will help me keep all my tasks and appointments in place. 
To use it, just pick a time-block, and enter a task due at a specific hour, whether it is a meeting, a scheduled
call to make, or any task that needs to be done at that time.
To save this task, just hit the corresponding cloud to the right of your text.  This will save to local storage,
that is, storage on your computer.  Don't worry!  The space it takes up is miniscule!<br>



Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
<ul>
<li>Grey represents the past.</li>
<li>Red represents the current hour.</li>
<li>Green represents the future.</li>
</ul>
